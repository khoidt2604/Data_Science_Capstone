# üéØ Model Comparison for Student Dropout Prediction

This repository contains Python code and analysis for comparing multiple machine learning models to predict student dropout. The goal is to identify the most effective model using validation and test accuracy as key metrics.

---

## üìå Introduction

This project evaluates different classification models for predicting student dropout using a dataset that includes demographic and academic attributes. By training and validating multiple models, the project identifies the most reliable classifier for accurate and generalisable predictions.

The primary aim is to assist educators and institutions in making data-driven decisions to support students at risk of dropping out.

## üí° Motivation

With increasing concerns around student attrition in educational institutions, developing predictive systems can be an effective early intervention strategy. This project explores and compares the performance of several supervised learning models to determine the most suitable algorithm for identifying at-risk students.

## üìä Key Visualisations

### 1. Accuracy Comparison of Models

This bar chart displays both validation and test accuracy for four classification models:

![Accuracy Comparison Bar Chart](bar_chart.png)

> As seen above, the **Decision Tree** model achieved the highest accuracy on both validation and test sets, suggesting better generalisability and predictive power.

### 2. Accuracy Scores Table

| Model                  | Validation Accuracy | Test Accuracy |
|------------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| Logistic Regression    | 0.8464              | 0.8333        |
| Support Vector Machine | 0.8482              | 0.8333        |
| Decision Tree          | **0.8893**          | **0.8889**    |
| K‚ÄìNearest Neighbor     | 0.8482              | 0.8333        |

The **Decision Tree** classifier performed best, with both the highest validation and test accuracy, making it the most robust model in this analysis.
